## Users
- As a user, I want to be presented with a choice of three different images of randomly selected products out of a pool of images. 
- As a user, after I select an image, I would like my selection and my total clicks to be recorded so that after going through all rounds, all of my data can be presented to me.
- As a user, I would like to be able to select anywhere on each image for ease of use.
